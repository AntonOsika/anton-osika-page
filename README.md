# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: curious-agents-narrative 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: Landing page

Minimalist, but with some animations an curly and gradient text
This should not be too salesy.

I am Anton Osika

A few things about me:
- Grew up in Stockholm, Sweden, which is a great place but unfortunately not as dense with high-agency people as I realised other places are 
- Role models are Feynmann and similar Physcisists that came after him
- I like solving neglected problem 
- Founders pledge
- Helped build Sana Labs, Depict.ai, Lovable
- Considered going into AI Safety way back before it was "cool", but startups are too alluring

Some of my beliefs

* state of the art results on student modeling learning
